# Budget App Development Workflow

When the user asks to develop or implement features for this budget app:

1. **Read TODO.md** (project root) first.
2. Work from the list in dependency order (Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5).
3. Mark completed tasks as `[x]` and in-progress tasks as `[~]` in TODO.md.
4. Reference PRD.md and DesignDoc.md (project root) for specifications.
5. Skip optional features (Phase 5) unless explicitly requested.
